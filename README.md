# Identifying-Potential-Customers

The objective of this project is to identify the potential customers that are likely to set up a term deposit at a Portuguese 
banking institution along with the key characteristics that add value to the marketing campaign. After 
preprocessing the data, that includes treating the imbalanced class through sampling techniques, we have 
evaluated the performance of several classification models such as Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random 
Forests, Gradient Boosting Classifier, K-NN and SVM. Random Forest ended up as the best performing model
among all of them, where F1-Score has been chosen as the evaluation criteria.


The repository contains several jupyter notebooks and a rmd file that contains the initial data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
