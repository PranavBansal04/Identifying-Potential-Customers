# Identifying-Potential-Customers

The objective of this project is to identify the potential customers that are likely to set up a term deposit at a Portuguese 
banking institution along with the key characteristics that add value to the marketing campaign. After 
preprocessing the data, that includes treating the imbalanced class through sampling techniques, we have 
evaluated the performance of several classification models such as Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random 
Forests, Gradient Boosting Classifier, K-NN and SVM. Random Forest ended up as the best performing model
among all of them, where F1-Score has been chosen as the evaluation criteria.


The repository contains several jupyter notebooks and a rmd file that contains the initial data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.


## Summary

- ### Background
Banks use depositorâ€™s money to make loans. Term deposits which are deposits in a financial institution with a specific 
maturity rate are one of the major sources for a bank which they can use to make loans[1]. Banks follow various marketing 
strategies like email marketing, SMS/Phone call marketing, advertisements etc. to reach out to the customers. Phone call 
campaigning is one of the traditional forms of marketing and, when done suitably, can have the best results. Most of the 
businesses follow a priority queue where they shortlist the customers, they believe are likely to convert. Organizations allot 
a huge number of resources towards organizing such campaigns which makes the task of identifying potential customers a 
crucial one. Our aim is to identify such potential customers that the bank could target and help banks make optimal usage 
of their resources .

- ### Dataset
The data contains information about a marketing campaign conducted by the Central Bank of the Portuguese Republic[4]
with phone calls as the medium of communication. There are about 41,188 observations and 20 
variables/features including consumer price index, marital status, employment variation rate, average yearly balance etc[5]. 
The dataset is split into train and test sets in the ratio 80:20.

- ### Goal of the Project
The main goal of the project is to identify the potential customers who are likely to set up a term deposit using a robust 
classifier based on relevant features/predictors. We intend to identify the key characteristics that makes a customer, a 
potential customer. This kind of analysis may also reveal reasons that lead to customers not setting up term deposits, which 
in some cases may be resolved by the Bank.
